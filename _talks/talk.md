Temperature was the most dominating process parameter that impacted fines deposition on the hydrotreating catalyst. X-ray fluorescence showed: asphaltene coated kaolin was deposited at the bottom of the reactor, whereas, kaolin got deposited in the top zone of the catalyst bed. 
Optimized hydrotreating conditions were established to minimize fines deposition.
