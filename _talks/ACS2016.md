High fines concentration in the feed (particle loading) and high temperature led to
higher bed deposition. The results obtained helped in understanding the impact of process parameters on particle deposition in a
batch reactor and not in a packed bed reactor. The optimum temperature to have a significant sulfur conversion with least fines
deposition for LGO feed with process conditions within the boundary of this research for a batch reactor was found to be in
range of 360 to 364 °C.
