Screening of TMs to understand the nature of atomically dispersed sites was successfully accomplished and the trends for the most commonly used TMs– Ni, Pd, and Pt on MgO were experimentally studied. This experiment-theory integrated synthesis creates a pathway towards predictive and well-defined site synthesis for targeted stability and activity.
